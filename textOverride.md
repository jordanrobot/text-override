by: Matthew D. Jordan

TO -> starts Text Override

Select dimension(s):  -> it will only select dimensions, so feel free to select regular objects, they will not be affected.  You can also select your dimensions before you start the command.

Enter Override Text: ->  Guess what happens here?  You can also enter shortcuts (upper or lower-case) for commonly used dimension notes. These are listed below and at the prompt.  Also, you can clear a text override by entering nothing at the text prompt.

C		dim OC
CT		dim OC TYP
CTC		dim CTC
NCT		dim <newline> OC TYP
TH		dim THRU
S		dim (Skin)
